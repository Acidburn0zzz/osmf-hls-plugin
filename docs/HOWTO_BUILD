If you want to build your own version of the plugin, you have two options:
    1) Ant-build.
    2) Build by Flash Builder.
    
1. Ant-build:
    - Download Adobe Flex 4.6 SDK and extract it into /buildtools/sdks/4.6.0 folder.
    - Run the command-line tool, go to root project dir, and run 'ant'.
    - You can find new binaries in /release folder.
    
2. Flash Builder way:
    - In FB menu select: File - Import Flash Builder Project...
    - Select 'Project Folder' option, press 'Browse', and find HLSPlugin project folder (inside root project directory)
    - Press 'Finish'.
    - Repeat this steps for HLSDynamicPlugin and HLSTestPlayer (optional).
    - Build project.
    - You can find the binaries in the following folders:
        - /release, if you built release version
        - /bin-debug sub-folder of the project (HLSDynamicPlugin/bin-debug as example), if you built debug version.
    HLSPlugin.swc always resides in /release folder.
