DEFAULT USING:
You can use the plugin with any OSMF2.0-based player.
Two most common use cases are described below:

1. StrobeMediaPlayback (must be OSMF2.0 based!):
    - put HLSDynamicPlugin.swf into any folder on your web-server (I recommend select folder near SMP, though)
    - in the .html-code of player page, find a section where 'flashvars' are initialized.
    On the default page it looks like this:
    var parameters = {
        src: "http://184.72.239.149/vod/smil:BigBuckBunny.smil/playlist.m3u8",
        verbose: true,
        controlBarAutoHide: false,
        controlBarPosition: "bottom",
        poster: "images/poster.png",
        initialBufferTime: 16,
        expandedBufferTime: 32,
        autoPlay: false
    };
    - and just by adding a string to it You get:
        hls_plugin: "<path/to/your/>HLSDynamicPlugin.swf" (<path/to/your> - replace with the real plugin folder)
    After this player params must look like this:
    var parameters = {
        src: "http://184.72.239.149/vod/smil:BigBuckBunny.smil/playlist.m3u8",
        verbose: true,
        controlBarAutoHide: false,
        controlBarPosition: "bottom",
        poster: "images/poster.png",
        initialBufferTime: 16,
        expandedBufferTime: 32,
        autoPlay: false,
        hls_plugin: "HLSDynamicPlugin.swf"
    };
    - that's all
    
2. Your own OSMF2.0-based player:
    That's simple :). Just install the plugin like any other OSMF-based plugin. You can use either HLSPlugin.swc or dynamic HLSDynamicPlugin.swf static library.
    To learn how to embed the plugin into the OSMF player You can look into the OSMF documentation ( http://osmf.org/developers.html ).
    

SETTINGS:
Plugin used some buffer control settings (all in HLSSettings.as file) you can change it as you want (but remember about rebuild plugin after changes!)
hlsBufferSizePause = 32 - buffer size when player paused
hlsBufferSizeBig = 16 - buffer size when all good with bandwidth
hlsBufferSizeDef = 4 - default OSMF buffer time

and some error catching settings:
hlsMaxReloadRetryes = 5 - for HTTPHLSNetStream, when live-stream playing. Number of reload playlist tries.
hlsReloadTimeout = 5000 - timeout between playlist reloads

hlsMaxErrors = 10 - for HTTPStreamingHLSIndexHandler (for live-streaming, again). Used when playlist "stuck" on server, and request returns not updated playlist.
